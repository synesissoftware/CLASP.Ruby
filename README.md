## Introduction

**CLASP** stands for **C**ommand-**L**ine **A**rgument **S**orting and **P**arsing. The first **CLASP** library was a C library with a C++ wrapper (see project [**CLASP**](https://github.com/synesissoftware/CLASP/)). There have been several implementations in other languages (as listed in [Relation projects](#related-projects)). **CLASP.Ruby** is the Ruby version.

All **CLASP** libraries provide the facilities to **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface (**CLI**) programs as described in detail below.

### libCLImate.Ruby

The [**libCLImate.Ruby**](https://github.com/synesissoftware/libCLImate.Ruby) library is implemented in terms of **CLASP.Ruby** but provides a higher-level abstration as well as several utility functions and the facility to fully specify command-line arguments declaratively in the `__END__` section of a source file. More information and examples provided in the [**libCLImate.Ruby**](https://github.com/synesissoftware/libCLImate.Ruby) project.

## Installation

Install via **gem** as in:

```
    gem install clasp-ruby
```

or add it to your `Gemfile`.

Use via **require**, as in:

```Ruby
require 'clasp'
```

## Components

### Command-line parsing

All **CLASP** libraries discriminate between three types of command-line arguments:

 * *flags* are hyphen-prefixed arguments that are either present or absent, and hence have a boolean nature;
 * *options* are hyphen-prefixed arguments that are given values; and
 * *values* are non-hyphen-prefixed arguments that represent values.

For example, in the command line

```
    myprog --all -c --opt1=val1 infile outfile
```

there are:

 * two *flags*, `--all` and `-c`;
 * one *option* called `--opt1`, which has the value `val1`; and
 * two *values* `infile` and `outfile`.

*Flags* and *options* may have alias. If the alias for `--all` is `-a` and the alias for `--opt1` is `-o` then the following command-line is exactly equivalent to the previous one:

```
    myprog -a -c -o val1 infile outfile
```

One-letter *flags* may be combined. Hence, the following command-line is exactly equivalent to the previous ones:

```
    myprog -ac -o val1 infile outfile
```

Option aliases may specify a value. If the alias `-v1` means `--opt1=val1` then the following command-line is exactly equivalent to the previous ones:

```
    myprog -ac -v1 infile outfile
```

Option aliases that are one letter may be combined with one-letter flags. If the alias `-v` means `--opt1=val1` then the following command-line is exactly equivalent to the previous ones:

```
    myprog -acv infile outfile
```

UNIX standard arguments confer specific meanings:

 * `--help` means that the program should show the usage/help information and terminate;
 * `--version` means that the program should show the version information and terminate;
 * `--` means that all subsequent arguments should be treated as values, regardless of any hyphen-prefixes or embedded `=` signs.

### Declarative specification of the flags and options for a CLI

To support such above special processing, CLASP libraries provide facilities
for declarative specification of command-line *flags* and *options*, and
aliases thereof. For the previous example, the **CLASP.Ruby** code would look
like the following:

```ruby

# file: cr-example.rb

PROGRAM_VERSION = '0.1.2'

Specifications = [

    CLASP.Flag('--all', alias: '-a', help: 'processes all item types'),
    CLASP.Flag('-c', help: 'count the processed items'),
    CLASP.Option('--opt1', alias: '-o', help: 'an option of some kind', values_range: %w{ val1, val2 }),
    CLASP.Flag('--opt1=val1', alias: '-v'),

    # see next section for why these two are here
    CLASP::Flag.Help,
    CLASP::Flag.Version,
]

# assuming the command-line `myprog -acv infile outfile`
Args = CLASP::Arguments.new(ARGV, Specifications)

puts Args.flags.size                # => 2
puts Args.flags[0].name             # => "--all"
puts Args.flags[1].name             # => "-c"

puts Args.options.size              # => 1
puts Args.options[0].name           # => "--opt1"
puts Args.options[0].value          # => "val1"

puts Args.values.size               # => 2
puts Args.values[0]                 # => "infile"
puts Args.values[1]                 # => "outfile"

```

### Utility functions for displaying usage and version information

There are aspects common to all CLI programs, such as responding to `--help` and `--version`. All **CLASP** libraries provide facilities to assist the programmer: **CLASP.Ruby** provides the two module methods CLASP.show_usage() and CLASP.show_version(), as shown in the following code extending the example above:

```ruby

Args.flags.each do |f|

    case f.name
    when CLASP::Flag.Help.name

        CLASP.show_usage(Specifications, exit: 0, values: '<input-file> <output-file>')
    when CLASP::Flag.Version.name

        CLASP.show_version(Specifications, exit: 0, version: PROGRAM_VERSION)
    when '--all'

        # do something appropriate to `--all`

    . . .

```

Given the command

```
    ./cr-example.rb --help
```

then the program will output the following

```
USAGE: cr-example.rb [ ... flags and options ... ] <input-file> <output-file>

flags/options:

    -a
    --all
        processes all item types

    -c
        count the processed items

    -v --opt1=val1
    -o <value>
    --opt1=<value>
        an option of some kind where <value> one of:
            val1,
            val2

    --help
        shows this help and terminates

    --version
        shows version and terminates

```

and given the command

```
    ./cr-example.rb --version
```

then the program will output the following

```
cr-example.rb 0.1.2
```
